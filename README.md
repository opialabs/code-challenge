# code-challenge

Using https://openweathermap.org/api or similar API, create a simple web app which supports the following functionality.

* User types in a city name (autocomplete) and it shows the current weather along with next 3/5 days prediction (the more information you show the better) in a structured way.
* Caches the result for searched cities for 24 hours so another API lookup isn't necessary if the same city is searched again within 24 hours of previous search. 
* Stores all searched cities in DB along with the time at which search was done. Based on stored data, show simple graphical stats like most searched cities (along with count) in last 24 hours and last 7 days. Add a separate page/route for displaying this section.
* Wow us if you can by doing something extra. Totally optional ;)

# Notes

* Use your judgement in case you aren't sure about how a particular thing needs to be shown/implemented or which libraries to use.
* No design/styling work needed but would be good if an open source library/UI-toolkit is used with ready to use design elements/components.
* To submit your code, create a public repo on Github using your account and share the repo link to our email at which you have been corresponding with us. Note that your repo should include clear instructions on how to setup/install the app.
